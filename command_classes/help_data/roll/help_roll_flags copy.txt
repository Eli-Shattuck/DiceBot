Flags-
	*	-adv
		takes no arguments, rolls each die twice and picks the maximum value.
	*	-dis
		takes no arguments, rolls each die twice and picks the minimum value.
	*	-sum
		takes no arguments, returns the sum of all values rolled (after picking if a -pick is specified)
    *	-sort
		takes no arguments, returns the rolls in decreasing sorted order
    *	-isort (increasing sort)
		takes no arguments, returns the rolls in increasing sorted order
    *	-chist
		takes three arguments 𝓁, 𝑠, and 𝘱, and includes a simple histogram, the maximum width of a bar is 𝓁, the character or string used to represent the bar is 𝑠, and 𝘱 determines if the roll values are printed 
        𝓁 and 𝘱 are integers where 0 <= 𝓁 <= 100, and 0 <= 𝘱 <= 1. 𝑠 is any sequence of characters containing no whitespace
    *	-hist
		takes no arguments, includes a simple histogram of the rolled values after the rolls (equivalent to -chist 20 = 0)
    *	-pick
		takes one argument, 𝘱, and returns the 𝘱 largest rolls
        𝘱 is an integer where 0 <= 𝘱 <= 10000
    * 	-loop
		takes one argument, 𝓁, and runs the command 𝓁 times
        𝓁 is an integer where 0 <= 𝓁 <= 100
