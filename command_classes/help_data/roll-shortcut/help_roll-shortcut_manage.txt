The Roll-Shortcut Command!
There are three functions used to manage your already created shortcuts:

`--roll-shortcut fetch NAME`
This command will retrieve a saved shortcut named `NAME` that you have previously created, so you can use it.

`--roll-shortcut show all`
This command will show a list of all your created shortcuts.

`--roll-shortcut delete NAME`
This command deletes a shortcut named `NAME` you have saved.
