Welcome to Combat-Timer!
The `--combat-timer` command allows you to create a "chess clock" for any number of people. This means that it will have a timer for each player. If a timer is running, the :next: emoji, picturing two arrows to the right, can be used to stop the current timer and start the timer of the next player. This sequence will loop.

This was designed for DnD and other ttrpgs, so the command will take in a number that represents a player's initiative, or priority, and order the sequence according to these. A player can be added multiple times in the rotation, so a game master can control multiple enemies with different places in the sequence.
