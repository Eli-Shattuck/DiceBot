Example of a Full Combat Timer
```
--combat-timer 6:30 The Rat Fight
"Julia" 17
"Bazz" 13
"Eli" 12
"Luis" 18
"Dan" 9
"Nick" 14
"Tim_Rat 1" 7 20:00
"Tim_Rat 2" 14
"Tim_Rat King" 11
```
This command creates a combat timer where each player except for Tim has 6 minutes and 30 seconds on their clock. Tim has 20 minutes, and will come up in the rotation three times, each appearing with a different tag so he knows what creature to play.
