        𝓁 and 𝘱 are integers where 0 <= 𝓁 <= 100, and 0 <= 𝘱 <= 1. 𝑠 is any sequence of characters containing no whitespace
    *	-hist
		takes no arguments, includes a simple histogram of the rolled values after the rolls (equivalent to -chist 20 = 0)
    *	-pick
		takes one argument, 𝘱, and returns the 𝘱 largest rolls
        𝘱 is an integer where 0 <= 𝘱 <= 10000
