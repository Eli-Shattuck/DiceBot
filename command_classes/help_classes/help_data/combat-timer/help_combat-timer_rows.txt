Indroduction to Using Combat-Timer:  The Rows
After entering the first line of the command (see `--help combat-timer header`), the rest of the call to the command is made up of rows.
There can be any number of rows, and they each have the same format:
```"name_tag" initiative mins:secs```
Let's discuss each part:
\t*`name_tag` is used to enter the display name of a player. It must be surrounded by quotes, and gives two parts: `name` and `tag` that must be separated by an underscore ('_').
\t*`name`: The timer will be displayed with `name`. Each player will have only one name. Adding another player with the same name will add them to the initiative order again, but will not create an additional timer.

Continue to the next page or type `--help combat-timer rows(cont)` to see the other parts.
