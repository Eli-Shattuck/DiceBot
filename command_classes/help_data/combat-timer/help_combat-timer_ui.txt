How To Interact with a Combat Timer
When a combat timer is made, the bot will react to it with an X and a PLAY button. 
\t*`X`:  The X will stop the timer permanently and remove the reactions that let you interact with it. This can only be done by the creator.
\t*`PLAY`:  The PLAY button will start the timer of the player that is up next in the order. This will remove the PLAY button, replacing it with PAUSE and NEXT.
\t*`NEXT`:  The NEXT button will stop the timer of the current player and advance the order, starting the timer of the next player.
\t*`PAUSE`:  The PAUSE button will stop the current timer. This will also remove the PAUSE and NEXT button, replacing it with a PLAY button.
\t*`DECREASE`: The creator can press this to instead make the timers increase.
\t*`INCREASE`: The creator can press this to instead make the timers decrease.
