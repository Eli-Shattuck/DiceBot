The Roll-Shortcut Command!
```
--roll-shortcut new NAME
"action 1" val 𝑛d𝑥+𝑏 damageType
"action 2" val 𝑛d𝑥+𝑏 damageType
\t .
\t .
```
-The shortcut is created with the name `NAME` and can have up to four actions. 
-Each action has a name, given in quotes, like `"action 1"`. 
-The value `val` is one of two things: It can be an attack bonus, such as +5 or -2. If the action instead uses a saving throw, you can give the saving throw as long as you do not use spaces, such as DC17_Wisdom.
-The term `𝑛d𝑥+𝑏` represents a number of dice rolled plus a bonus as the damage roll for the action. See the help pages for the `--roll` command for details. 
-The `damageType` term can be any one word damage type, such as radiant, for the damage roll.
