The Roll-Shortcut Command!
The roll-shortcut command is used to create and manage shortcuts that allow you to quickly roll for common actions used by ttrpg characters. There are 4 functions:

\t* `new`: Used to create a new shortcut
\t* `fetch`: Used to access a saved shortcut
\t* `show all`: Lists all shortcuts you have created
\t* `delete`: Used to delete a saved shortcut

Each action in a shortcut will have two parts. The first will be an attack roll or will display the DC for a saving throw. The second will be a damage roll. Look through the following pages to learn how to use `--roll-shortcut`!
