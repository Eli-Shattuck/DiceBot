Removing a Player from an existing Combat Timer
After creating a combat timer, you may want to remove a player, such as when a character dies. This can be done with the command:
```--combat-timer removeplayer "name_tag"```
Where `tag` is optional. If a tag is given, all instances of that player with that tag in the initiative order will be removed. If a tag is not given, all instances of that player will be removed from the initiative order. This will not remove their timer.
