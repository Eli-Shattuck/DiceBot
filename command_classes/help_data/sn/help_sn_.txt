The SN Command!
The command `--sn` has been made to help introduce the idea of snake people to users of \DiceBot!
Simply call `--sn` before any other command to modify the output of that command to better suit our serpentine bretheren. Try some of my favorites:

\t* `--sn --say`  Modify any sentence for \DiceBot to say!
\t* `--sn --help`  Help our scaly friends use \DiceBot!
\t* `--sn --timer`  Keep the time for your favorite snakes!
